In this project are 3 types of users: administrator, employee and client, each with a username and password.
The administrator can import a set of profuses, perform raw operations and create a product composed of different basic products from the menu. I generated reports that were written in a txt file. The reports were generated according to the following criteria: the time interval between orders, the products ordered more than the specified number, the customers who ordered more than the specified number and the products ordered on a certain day.
The customer can register, see the products on the menu, search for products on the menu and create an order.
The employee will be notified upon receipt of a new order.
